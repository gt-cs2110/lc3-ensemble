//! Simulating and execution for LC-3 assembly.
//! 
//! This module is focused on executing fully assembled code (i.e., [`ObjectFile`]).
//! 
//! This module consists of:
//! - [`Simulator`]: The struct that simulates assembled code.
//! - [`mem`]: The module handling memory relating to the registers.
//! - [`io`]: The module handling simulator IO.
//! - [`debug`]: The module handling types of breakpoints for the simulator.
